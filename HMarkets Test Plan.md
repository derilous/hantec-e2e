# Test Plan: HMarkets Forms Automation with Selenium JavaScript

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for automating the testing of key registration forms on the [https://hmarkets.com](https://hmarkets.com) website using Selenium WebDriver with JavaScript. The primary goal is to ensure the forms function correctly, handle valid and invalid inputs appropriately, and provide a seamless user experience.

## 2. Test Objectives

- Verify successful submission of the **Live Registration Form** with valid data.
- Verify successful submission of the **Demo Registration Form** (MT4 and MT5 variants) with valid data.
- Validate form input mechanisms, ensuring appropriate error messages or rejections for invalid data.
- Confirm correct navigation and success messages/redirections after submissions.
- Identify any critical defects or usability issues within form submission processes.

## 3. Types of Testing

### Functional Testing

- Verify all form fields accept and process valid inputs.
- Confirm dropdowns (e.g., leverage, deposit, country) work as expected.
- Ensure form submission completes successfully, leading to expected outcomes.

### Negative Testing

- Test fields with invalid data (e.g., empty required fields, incorrect passwords, whitespace-only input).
- Ensure system correctly rejects invalid submissions and shows validation messages.

### Regression Testing

- While not a dedicated phase initially, tests will be re-runnable to catch regressions from future changes.

### UI/UX Testing (Automated Checks)

- Verify presence and visibility of UI elements (cookie banner, password rules, success messages).
- Check interactivity of buttons, dropdowns, etc.

## 5. Coverage Approach

To ensure comprehensive test coverage:

- **Form Identification:** Target Live and Demo Registration Forms.
- **Field Coverage:** Each required input field covered by positive and negative tests.
- **Dropdown Coverage:** All select elements tested.
- **Validation:** Client- and server-side validations implicitly tested through input variation.
- **Success/Error Handling:** Each test validates correct feedback or navigation.
- **Cookie Handling:** Banner dismissal is automated to avoid interference.
- **Password Checks:** Password criteria are thoroughly validated.
- **Data Generation:** Uses `faker-js` to create unique, realistic data each run.
- **Modular Test Design:** Reusable modules (`formCommands.js`, `formData.js`, `passwordUtils.js`, `selectors.js`) enhance scalability and maintainability.

This test plan forms the foundation for automated functional and negative testing of the HMarkets registration forms.
